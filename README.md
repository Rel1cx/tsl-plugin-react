# tsl-plugin-react

Bring the same linting functionality that [`eslint-react`](https://eslint-react.xyz) has to the TypeScript LSP.

A [`tsl`](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/typescript-linter) plugin that allows additional refactors and diagnostics with your VSCode editor (or any editor that supports TypeScript's LSP).
